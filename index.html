								<h2 class="major">Project Description</h2>
								<br>
								<br>
                <h2 class="nametitle">Roles:</h2>
								<p>In terms of roles for our project, we did not necessarily have any set roles. The only person who was consistently in a role was Stephen as lead developer. The reason why Stephen was lead on the project is due to the main idea being his. This allowed for a clear, unique vision that could be implemented and changed to suit the overall goal. As for the rest of the group, all of us have similar interchangeable skill sets. Naveen took an overall leadership role by organizing meetings, agendas, the report, and the website. In terms of prototype development, research, etc. All members were able to divide the work somewhat evenly and successfully complete the task. Overall, our skills are quite similar and therefore allowed us to be flexible with the work and not limit people to specific roles.</p>
								<br>
							  <br>
								<h2 class="nametitle">Scope and Limits:</h2>
								<p>
									The scope of our project SAFE-RAP is to create a deeper effort in the adoption of household animals, saving them from euthanasia and growing old in adoption centres. Through mobile devices, as nowadays almost everyone carries mobile devices, our project creates an easier opportunity for those who want to adopt and save animals using a simple mobile application. However, as this project is being developed in a strict timeframe, we are focusing on providing some artifacts about the main features / pages which include:<br>

									<br>1.	Creation of accounts (Signing up / Singing in)<br>
									This feature will create a more personalised experience with the use of the app allowing the user to tinker with the application to how they see fit, also allowing them to shortlist animals they are interested in.<br>

									<br>2.	Main page.<br>
									The main page, showing the user the animals that are currently up for adoption, allowing the user to swipe left to shortlist the animals and swipe right to skip the animals. This page also includes accessibility controls at the bottom of the screen with buttons to: Go back, skip, shortlist and donate.<br>

									<br>3.	User profile.<br>
									The user profile page consists of different subpages the app has available for users with differing purposes these sub-pages include; User, Animal, Shelter and Adopter. Every user fall under the “User” subpage, forcing them to provide ID Verification to prove their identity. The “Animal” subpage allows the users to register animals they would like to put up for adoption, prompting the user to detail the animal as much as possible and includes fields that are required to fill in. The “Shelter” subpage allows the user to register their business as an animal shelter on our app. The idea behind this is to decrease verification time and increase trust when listing animals that are under the shelters name, however given the timeframe we must work on this project, this is not within our scope but something that would be included if we had more time. The final subpage “Adopter” allows the user to input further information about themselves allowing the animal listers to have a more in-depth view on the adopter.<br>

									<br>4.	Settings.<br>
									The setting page focuses on the user’s preferences, this include the location range, how far away they are willing to go, what kind of pets they are looking for, an option to update information about themselves and allowing them to create profiles for their pets and shelters.<br>

									<br>5.	Donations.<br>
									The donations page will allow the users that cannot adopt pets to still offer their help through donations to a select few shelters such as: RSPCA, Animal Aid and Zoobie.<br>

									<br>However, features such as the verification of users and ABN’S is not within our scope but just proof of concept in the artifacts we are providing. Furthermore, our goal of having a location, matching and payment system is not within our scope but is another goal we are aiming if we had more time to develop our project.

								<h2 class="nametitle">Group Processes and Communication</h2>
								<p>At the start of the project, we as a group had a discussion and tried to find times that we were all available. This allowed us to create a schedule in which our meetings would take place. This was very valuable as it ensured that the work and meeting completed was done as a team and not individually. We chose to use Teams for all our meetings and used class time for face to face discussions. Working as a group allows multiple points of views and flow amongst the report. Although we allotted free time to meet, sometimes things come up and individuals are unable to join the meeting. We alleviated this issue by scheduling, 3 meetings, consistently updating the actions and being clear and concise in our meetings. By doing this, even if someone missed a meeting, they would be able to catch up and get back on track. Luckily, we didn’t have issues in terms of group members not responding. However if we did encounter this issue, we would either continue and report it to Anthony, if the member came back before we reported the issue, we would inform them of what has happened and ensure work was distributed fairly to reflect their lack of communication. Overall, fortunately our group processes and communication suffered little to no issues.</p>
